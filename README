  // django-template-compilation (project: templatetk)

  This is a Google Summer of Code project that attempts to implement
  template compilation for Django.  It not only tries to do that for
  Django but it tries to keep the compiler generic enough that it
  works with arbitrary template engines including Jinja2 and possible
  others.
